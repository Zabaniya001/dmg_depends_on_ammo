# dmg_depends_on_ammo
Custom Attribute using Nosoop's framework. It deals dmg depending on the amount of ammo you've got. The more you have it, the more dmg you deal.

This plugin uses Nosoop's [Ninja](https://github.com/nosoop/NinjaBuild-SMPlugin) template. Easy to organize everything and build releases. I'd recommend to check it out.

Also I've got no clue how to properly format this.
